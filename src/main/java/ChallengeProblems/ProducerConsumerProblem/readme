1) A JVM's thread scheduler schedules green threads according to priorityâ€”a thread's relative importance,
which you express as an integer from a well-defined range of values.

2) Typically, a JVM's thread scheduler chooses the highest-priority thread and allows that thread to run until it either
terminates or blocks. At that time, the thread scheduler chooses a thread of the next highest priority.
That thread (usually) runs until it terminates or blocks.

3) If, while a thread runs, a thread of higher priority unblocks (perhaps the higher-priority thread's sleep time expired),
the thread scheduler preempts, or interrupts, the lower-priority thread and assigns the unblocked higher-priority thread to the processor.
